# Development

How to build BAOKEY firmware and run it without a badge. Everything here was run
on 2026-09-25 on Fedora 44 with Rust 1.96.0.

## Layout

```
BAOKEY/
├── xous-core/          our fork: KaraZajac/baokey-firmware (private), branch `baokey`     (gitignored clone)
├── tools/baomulator/   zst123/dc34_baomulator, full-system badge emulator            (gitignored clone)
├── patches/baomulator/ our changes to the emulator, applied on top of the clone
├── scripts/emu.sh      build → emulate → PNG screenshots, in one command
└── .emu/               emulator build output and screenshots                         (gitignored)
```

## One-time setup

```sh
# firmware source: our private fork. --reference reuses BAOSEC's objects so it's quick;
# drop those two flags on a machine without ~/Projects/BAOSEC.
git clone --reference ~/Projects/BAOSEC/xous-core --dissociate --branch baokey \
    https://github.com/KaraZajac/baokey-firmware.git xous-core
git -C xous-core remote add upstream https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core.git
git -C xous-core fetch upstream --tags

# emulator
git clone https://github.com/zst123/dc34_baomulator.git tools/baomulator
git -C tools/baomulator apply "$PWD"/patches/baomulator/*.patch
```

The Xous toolchain (`riscv32imac-unknown-xous-elf`) must match your `rustc` exactly;
see `~/Projects/BAOSEC/SETUP.md`. The build stamps its version from upstream's git tags
and fails without them, which is why the fork is its own repo rather than a folder in
this one.

## The fork

`KaraZajac/baokey-firmware` is private, holds upstream's full history, and has two
branches: `dev`, an untouched mirror of upstream `dev`, and `baokey`, where our work
goes. **GitHub Actions is switched off on it**: upstream's workflows would otherwise run
on every push (two of them trigger on any branch) and spend private-repo minutes. Turn
it back on deliberately if we want our own CI.

Syncing with upstream:

```sh
cd xous-core
git fetch upstream --tags
git switch dev && git merge --ff-only upstream/dev && git push origin dev --tags
git switch baokey && git merge dev
```

## The loop

```sh
cd xous-core && cargo xtask baosec-lite baokey-launcher vault2 && cd ..   # ~6 min cold, ~3 warm
scripts/emu.sh 3G,4G                                                     # ~2 min for 4G instructions
```

Screenshots land in `.emu/shots/*.png`. Buttons for `--press N@T`: `0` Down,
`1` Select, `2` Up, `3` Right, `4` Left, `5` Center. The emulator runs at roughly
30 million instructions per second, so `1G` ≈ 30 s of wall clock.

First boot of a fresh image, as observed: the PDDB finds blank flash, formats and mounts
**with no prompt**, swap encryption comes on, and the BAOKEY home screen is up by ~3G.
Every emulator run starts from blank flash, so every run is a first boot.

Launcher regression check (home → Vault → Vault Menu → Home screen → home → Vault):

```sh
scripts/emu.sh 3G,3.6G,4.1G,5G,5.6G,6.4G --press 1@3.1G --press 1@3.7G \
  --press 0@4.2G --press 0@4.35G --press 0@4.5G --press 0@4.65G --press 0@4.8G \
  --press 1@5.1G --press 1@5.8G
scripts/montage.py flow.png 3 .emu/shots/*.pgm   # the six frames as one image
```

The launcher logs `bringing 'Vault' to the front` and `'Vault' returned to the home
screen` on each change. Reading screenshots: the vault's TOTP view with no codes stored
shows `✕✕✕✕✕✕` in the code box, with the white bar under it as the 30-second countdown.

The first cold build signs with the post-quantum developer key (SLH-DSA), which is
slow; later builds reuse `devkey/dev-pq.cache`.

## Two emulators

- **Baomulator** (`scripts/emu.sh`) runs the real RISC-V images, loader onward:
  signatures, MMU, swap encryption, PDDB, OLED, buttons, camera. Use it to test
  exactly what would be flashed.
- **Hosted mode** (`cargo xtask baosec-emu`) runs each service as a native x86 process
  with the OLED in a desktop window. Much faster to iterate on UI, but it isn't the
  real binary.

## Emulator fidelity notes

- **Developer mode.** Baomulator starts at the loader and never runs `boot1`, so it
  can't cross the developer-mode door itself, and a developer-signed build dies with
  *"Kernel is devkey signed, but system is not in developer mode."* Our patch adds
  `emu_set_owc()` and `shot --dev-mode`, which presets one-way counter 85
  (`DEVELOPER_MODE`) before the first instruction. The loader's check is in
  `xous-core/loader/src/main.rs` (it also accepts an erase proof or an uninitialized
  counter 84).
- **Collateral.** The keystore logs *"Collateral is not erased - protocol error for
  Baochip firmwares!"* On hardware, `boot0` erases the collateral bank on every boot
  under a Baochip-signed `boot1`; the emulator never runs `boot0`. Harmless for now;
  modelling it means pre-filling slots 261–264 with the erase value.
- **Licensing.** Baomulator has no license file, so all rights are reserved: use it
  locally, don't vendor or redistribute it. Our patch is ours and could be offered
  upstream.
